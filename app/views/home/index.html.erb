			<h2>Ruby on Rails</h2>
			<p class="lead">A great backend Framework!
			<br />
			[Pulled from Wiki:]</p>
			<p>Ruby on Rails, often simply Rails, is an open source web application framework which runs via the Ruby programming language. It is a full-stack framework: it allows creating pages and applications that gather information from the web server, talk to or query the database, and render templates out of the box. As a result, Rails features a routing system that is independent of the web server.
			<br />
			<br />
			Ruby on Rails emphasizes the use of well-known software engineering patterns and principles, such as active record pattern, convention over configuration (CoC), don't repeat yourself (DRY), and model–view–controller (MVC).</p>

			<h2>Zurb Foundation 5</h2>
			<p class="lead">Goals of Foundation 5
			<br />
			[Pulled from their site:]
			</p>
			<p>Their goal: to provide a framework that allows others (and ourselves) build better designed future-friendly sites. Being the fastest way to responsively prototype and build for any device is not enough. Foundation also has to make us better designers that thrive in the ever-evolving world of mobile devices. That’s why we strive to make every new version of Foundation more advanced so you can code smarter and faster.</p>
